    <figcaption>These two pictures are about my moodboard that I did for my Production Design class. We had to take inspiration from a list of designers given to us and choose one. We also had to choose between a halftone or glitch aesthetic. I decided to pick April Grieman. What I took from here works were shapes and color but decided to put my own twist into it. The top photo is my first concept that I was planning on doing where I show a reflection but felt it was more glitch aesthetic. On the second photo take a big turn on my first concept. I still keep the shapes and color but completely put my own influence of what I find aesthetically pleasing, which is balance.

    <figcaption>Another project for Production Design. For this one we had to take information from a pdf containing infromation about type. It was about 16 pages worth of information and we had to fit it in about two 11x17 page posters. I am very proud of this piece, it was one of the projects that made me realize how good I was starting to become with design prior to the year before.
